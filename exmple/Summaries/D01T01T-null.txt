So I asked my sister, a doctor who was in her final year of MD at that time, with a hope that she'd diagnose it correctly.
I did a research about my symptoms on the net and got so scared knowing the different possible conditions that I might have got.
He doubted that it could be a type of TB and gave me a list of tests to be done the next day.
I showed him the symptoms and that's it, he got so shocked and shouted at me for not consulting a doctor soon enough.
