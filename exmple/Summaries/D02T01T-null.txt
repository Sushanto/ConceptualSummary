Beginning in 1918, Percherons began to be bred in Great Britain, and in 1918 the British Percheron Horse Society was formed.
Before World War I, thousands of Percherons were shipped from France to the United States, but after the war began, an embargo stopped shipping.
The breed is still used extensively for draft work, and in France they are used for food.
Purebred Percherons are used for forestry work and pulling carriages, as well as work under saddle, including competition in English riding disciplines such as show jumping.
