So I asked my sister, a doctor who was in her final year of MD at that time, with a hope that she'd diagnose it correctly.
It was a time when I was working in Chennai, staying in a PG, when I got rashes on my palm and feet and swollen lymph nodes all over my ear and neck.
I did a research about my symptoms on the net and got so scared knowing the different possible conditions that I might have got.
But there she was sounding like she couldn't care less.
